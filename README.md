# MBTA Tracker (Route 109)

This project collects raw MBTA v3 API data for route 109 to analyze
prediction reliability, vehicle assignment timing, and trip stability.

Current scope:
- Poll MBTA predictions and vehicles
- Log raw JSON responses (JSONL)
- No display or scoring logic yet

The project intentionally prioritizes data capture and analysis
before defining output or user-facing behavior.
